```
[ERROR] Saving to DB (E:\Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF\StaticAnalyzer\views\android\db_interaction.py,
 LINE 236 "static_db.save()"): table StaticAnalyzer_staticanalyzerandroid has no column named 
```

## Linux/Mac

```bash
cd Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/
git pull origin master
. venv/bin/activate
pip install --no-cache-dir --use-deprecated=legacy-resolver -r requirements.txt
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py makemigrations StaticAnalyzer
python manage.py migrate
deactivate
```

```batch
cd Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/
git pull origin master

pip install --no-cache-dir --use-deprecated=legacy-resolver -r requirements.txt
